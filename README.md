Diabetes Prediction Model
Overview
The Diabetes Prediction Model is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health measurements. This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and leverages logistic regression for classification. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of prediction accuracy.

Dataset
The model uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a publicly available dataset. The dataset contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that represents diabetes pedigree
Age: Age of the person (years)
Outcome: Binary variable (1 if the person has diabetes, 0 otherwise)
Features
Data Preprocessing:
Missing value check
Correlation analysis
Train-test split
Feature scaling using Standard Scaler
Machine Learning Model:
Logistic Regression for binary classification
Model Evaluation:
Accuracy score
Confusion matrix
Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
Install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these dependencies via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb.
Run the cells to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the logistic regression model.
The notebook will output the model's accuracy and display the confusion matrix and classification report for performance evaluation.
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of around X% (replace X with the actual accuracy achieved) on the test data.
The confusion matrix and classification report provide further insight into precision, recall, and F1-score.
Future Improvements
Implement additional machine learning models like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Improve data preprocessing with feature engineering or handling outliers.
